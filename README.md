# MAZBOOT 
3D e-commerce platform that combines human body models and product models for an immersive shopping experience.

## Features
1. View Items as 3D Models:
    . To display products as 3D models, yo ’ll need to incorporate Three.js (which you’ve already mentioned). Here’s how:
        . Product Details Page: When a user selects a product, load its 3D model dynamically. You can use formats like GLTF or OBJ.
        . Interactive Controls: Allow users to rotate, zoom, and pan around the 3D model. Consider adding buttons for predefined views (front, back, side).
        . Lighting and Shading: Apply appropriate lighting and shading to make the model look realistic.
2. Sizing Recommendations:
    . This is where it gets interesting! Let’s recommend sizes based on the user’s body measurements:
        . User Profile: Ask users to input their measurements (chest, waist, hips, etc.) during account setup.
        . Size Mapping: Map these measurements to standard clothing sizes (e.g., S, M, L, XL).
        . Algorithm: Implement an algorithm that suggests the best fit based on the product’s dimensions and the user’s measurements.
        .Visual Indicators: Highlight the recommended size on the product page (e.g., “Recommended Size: Medium”).
3. Virtual Fitting Room:
    . Imagine your users virtually trying on clothes! Here’s how:
        . Body Avatar: Create a 3D avatar of the user based on their measurements.
        . Overlay Clothing: When viewing a product, overlay the 3D model of the clothing onto the avatar.
        . Adjustment: Allow users to adjust the fit (tighter, looser) and see how it looks.
        . Feedback: Provide feedback (e.g., “This dress fits well in the waist but is too long; consider a smaller size.”).
4. Performance Considerations:
    . Loading 3D models can be resource-intensive. Optimize by:
        . Level of Detail (LOD): Use different levels of detail for distant and close-up views.
        . Caching: Cache models to reduce load times.
        . Progressive Loading: Load basic geometry first and enhance as needed.
5. Wishlist and Favorites:
    . Let users save products to their wishlist or favorites list.
     .Provide an easy way for them to access these saved items.
6. Product Recommendations:
    . Use machine learning algorithms (if possible) to recommend related products based on user behavior (e.g., viewed products, purchased items).
7. Checkout Process:
    . Guide users through a smooth checkout process.
    . Include steps like shipping address, payment method, and order summary.
